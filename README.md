# chroma-langchain

A repository to highlight examples of using the Chroma (vector database) with LangChain (framework for developing LLM applications).

For an example of using Chroma+LangChain to do question answering over documents, see [this notebook](qa.ipynb).
To use a persistent database with Chroma and Langchain, see [this notebook](qa_persistent.ipynb).
